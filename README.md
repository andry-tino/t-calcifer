# t-calcifer (Tutorial)

_Calcifer_ is a tutorial designed to take familiarity with a broad range of technologies:

- Web apps
- Visual Studio 2015

The purpose of it is not getting deep understanding of those technologies, but rather provide a generic overview of what they are and how they can empower a developer to build cool apps for all the stores.

1. [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx)
