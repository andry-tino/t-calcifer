# t-calcifer (Tutorial)
A tutorial project for building a universal web app with Visual Studio 2015 and Cordova

## About
_Calcifer_ is a tutorial designed to take familiarity with a broad range of technologies:

- Web apps
- Visual Studio 2015
- Cordova
- HTML5, Javascript, CSS

The purpose of it is not getting deep understanding of those technologies, but rather provide a generic overview of what they are and how they can empower a developer to build cool apps for all the stores.

### Who is this for?
This tutorial has been designed for very beginners. A very basic knowledge of Javascript is required, however it can be included as part of the experience.

### Requirements
For this tutorial you are going to need:

1. [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx)
2. A Windows Phone, or an Android phone

**Important:** Installation is not covered by this tutorial.

## Initial setup and project configuration
We start by creating a new _Cordova project_ in Visual Studio.

We can skip creating a folder for solution. So we now have a solution that we can use to build our app using HTML5, Javascript and CSS.

### Installing Cordova's Geolocation plug-in
The next step is installing the [Geolocation plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation). That is necessary because we want to use device's location API in order to get the position and show it on the map.

## Setting pages and layouts
We now move forward to creating some layout structures.

## Adding logic
We now need to have this this working.

### A bit about the algorithm
This is the algorithm.
